  <p class="text" id="Windsurf"> The sun is shining down through the tree leaves and the sound of a marching band can be heard in the distance. Just off Central Street, at a small card table, with an American flag table cloth, two girls sit shouting “Lemonade. Cupcakes. All money goes to charity.”
Ricky Gelboim and Mollie Mcdougall moved here in 2011 because they were both Northwestern graduates. They now have twins, Julia and Rachel, and their newest addition baby Alex.

<br />
Julia and Rachel decided they wanted to sell cupcakes and lemonade during the fourth of July parade to people walking to find seating. Their selection of treats included vanilla cupcakes with both vanilla and chocolate icing and lemonade pulled straight from a portable cooler.
Their mother, Mollie Mcdougall, was stationed down the street to get customers to go to the stand. She said that she and Julia had spent the time making the cupcakes, while Rachel was making their homemade signs.
<br />
“We got a kick out of getting it together and the girls love baking,” Mollie Mdougall said.
Instead of selling the cupcakes and lemonade they decided that they would give them out for free and instead encourage patrons to donate money to their collection box. The donations would then be given to the Beth Emet soup kitchen in Evanston. Both girls had graduated from the Beth Emet preschool the previous year so they decided to give back to their charity.
<br />
“We like spending time with family,” Ricky Gelboim said. “And we want to get them involved with good worthy charitable causes.”
<br/>
The girls made homemade signs that they put on trees so that people would be able to find the stand and they made two soup pots full of lemonade that filled up their fridge. They also woke up and iced the cupcakes earlier that morning.
<br />
Since the girls are both five this is only their second time watching fourth of July parade. Their mother wanted them to be able to do a fun activity while they were waiting for the parade to start.
“The girls aren’t ready to do the games for the older kids yet,” Mollie Mcdougall said. “This is something fun that we can do.”
	Once the parade started the family took down the lemonade stand and moved to their reserved seating area at 5 a.m. that Monday. After they watched the parade, the family planned to head to the lakefill to watch the fireworks where Rachel said she was looking forward to seeing the “colors”.
